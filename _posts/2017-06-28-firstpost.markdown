<p>Hi, my name is Bruno Jensen, I'm a Java architect and I've start in this role for the past 3 years.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of my journey I've aways focus my carrier to this goal and I studied a lot. But all makes sense when I've received my first architect challenge: to build a rule based engine for decision making.</p>
