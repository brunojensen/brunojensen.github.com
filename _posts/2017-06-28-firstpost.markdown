<p>Hi, my name is Bruno Jensen, I'm a Java architect and I've been in this role for the past 3 years.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of my journey I'll aways focus my carrier to this goal and I studded a lot. But all makes sense
when I get my first architect challenge, an rule based engine for decision making on send messages to the client.</p>
