<p>Hi, my name is Bruno Jensen, I'm a software engineer with almost 10 years of experience in Java architecture and development. Specialized in web application development, SOA architecture and DevOps. I'm an agile enthusiast, a problem solver, an autodidact, and I love coding. I like to think that everything that can be automated should be automated and automated at the right time, with Jenkins</p>
<p>I'm always studying new technologies and methodologies. I usually read 2 or more technical articles, per day, from a few blogs that I follow, like: Red Hat's Blog, Netflix's Tech Blog, Lightbend's blog, InfoQ, etc...</p>
<p>I'm currently a leading developer on a small team of amazing people who make my job easier, so I try to motivate them with different activities, such as coding dojo, lectures and small workshops.</p>
<p>I hope to do good posts in this blog. 'Cause if I'm not do that, I should shut it down! =)</p>
