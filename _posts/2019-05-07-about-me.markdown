Hi, my name is Bruno Jensen, I'm a software engineer with experience in the development and architecture of software for the financial services industry. Along with my career, I have been work mainly with Java technologies, but I also had the opportunity to lead a team of great people on previous experiences.

I'm problem solver, agile enthusiast and one of my biggest passion is coding.

I'm always studying new technologies and methodologies. I usually read 2 or more technical articles, per day, from a few blogs that I follow, like Red Hat's Blog, Netflix's Tech Blog, Lightbend's blog, InfoQ, etc...

In 2018 I had the opportunity to move to Berlin with my family and start a new challenge. We had a lot of different experiences along the run, but we still here and it's been really great.
