I was working as Senior developer for this company in Brazil when I start to het more responsibilities as technical leader, it was not really official but I had the trust of all developers and managers. Anayway, it was something new for me and I’ve accepted the challenge. So I started to learn more about leadership. If you’re a softwares developer or know someone that is, you probably knows how difficult is the communication, isn’t? Well it’s another subject.

### My first good decision

In that time we were working with a big legacy software and the development methodology was waterfall like, which was another problem, and the development team was composed by 5 or 7 developers and we also had BA, QA and so on.
There was a situation that happened a few times when developers and QAs got stuck in a infinite loop of opening/closing bugs and it usually makes them sad and tired, both sides. I realized that my duty was take the job away from the developer and give him a brand new, well shaped and less pressured. 

Not because I thought the guy will not be able to solve the current one, but because I knew that it was not healthy. The QA remain the same, unfortunately.

In the end, the feature was delivered with a few bugs on pre-production and I can explain why, the QA was not able to test all the edge cases because he was so much into that infinite loop that his test was vicious.

Later on, I’ve talked with the QA manager and he asked me what he could have done differently, I told him that a leader should do the things that the ones bellow his command doesn’t want to do. Not my words and not exactly the words...
