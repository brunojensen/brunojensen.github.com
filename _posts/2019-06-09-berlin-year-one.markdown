<p>Living abroad is one of the greatest experiences I faced in my live, with this post Iâ€™d like to share some of the good and not so good moments so far.</p>
<p>I was living in Porto Alegre with my family when I received a offer from a Germany company, to work as Senior Java Developer. It was not a easy process but after I complete all the required steps I need a good plan to start moving. And this is a important part of the process of moving abroad, you must have a plan.</p>
