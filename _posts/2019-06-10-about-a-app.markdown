Long time ago, I was working for this company in Brazil as Java consultant for one of their outsourcing project, it was a really good time.

One of the greatest initiatives of the company employees was to share knowledge between the coworkers. It was my first contact with this kind of culture inside a corporation and it makes me realize how great is to share something that you've learned with others.

Well, so then I went to one session about a mobile project that the company just released to production and was a success with the client. The thing start to got weird when the lead developer of the team, which had a lot of experience with .NET technologies and have just started to try out Java, start to show the source code with some of the patterns that their were using.

In that time I've never tried android development but I already had a lot of experience with Java and all I can say is that the software was working, but the code was far from good and they probably didn't used any static code analysis.

I was new in the company and already had meet a lot of great Java programmers that could do the same app with a better design and a understandable code, but instead of hire the proper people for the job the company decide to go with a less expensive approach, I don't know why.

Well, it was working but imagine if somebody asked for new features, in the end it could cost more than if it have been done properly from the beginning.
