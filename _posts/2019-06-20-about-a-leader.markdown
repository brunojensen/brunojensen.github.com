I was working as Senior developer for this company in Brazil when I start to het more responsibilities as technical leader, it was not really official but I had the trust of all developers and managers. Anayway, it was something new for me and I’ve accepted the challenge. So I started to learn more about leadership. If you’re a softwares developer or know someone that is, you probably knows how difficult is the communication, isn’t? Well it’s another subject.

### My first good decision

In that time we were working with a big legacy software and the development methodology was waterfall like, which was another problem, and the development team was composed by 5 or 7 developers and we also had BA, QA and so on.
There was a situation that happened a few times when developers and QAs got stuck in a infinite loop of opening/closing bugs and it usually makes them sad and tired, both sides. I realized that my duty was take the job away from the developer and give him a brand new, well shaped and less pressured. 

Not because I thought the guy will not be able to solve the current one, but because I knew that it was not healthy. The QA remain the same, unfortunately.

In the end, the feature was delivered with a few bugs on pre-production and I can explain why, the QA was not able to test all the edge cases because he was so much into that infinite loop that his test was vicious.

Later on, I’ve talked with the QA manager and he asked me what he could have done differently, I told him that a leader should do the things that the ones under his command doesn’t want to do. Not my words... 

### about a leader

Do you know Simon Sinek? then watch this TED talk [Why good leaders make you feel safe.](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_why_good_leaders_make_you_feel_safe/up-next?language=en). 

But leadership doesn’t ends here, you need to improve your skills and keep studying, but more importantly you need to listen to people’s feedback. And this I learned with my manager in that time who sent me a form with four simple questions - asking me to provide him feedback. 

Well, later on, I did the same and it was great because for the first time I’ve received some constructive critics and I could improve myself on that.

### the plan and the results 

At some point I was really confident and I had the company trust so I decided to create a plan to move to a next level of leadership: help them to create a culture.

As I mentioned before, we were using waterfall but at some point in the future an agile knowledge will be required and as I already have had some experience with scrum, as first I decided to put some ceremonies on practice, like: daily, planning and review. Didn’t work very well this mixture of waterfall and agile, but at least improved the team interaction. 

Second step was more funny, we start two activities for every end of “sprint”: coding dojo and lightning talks.

Lighting talks was basically two talks of 15 minutes each where someone from the team show some new technology or whatever nice stuff that he had in mind.

With Coding dojo, someone from team challenges the others with some exercise and provides a prize. If the team failed, the challenger keep the prize, otherwise it goes to the team.

We’ve done it like 5 times each of this activities.

The result was motivated people working hard and delivering great features. Unfortunately things moved on to another direction and all gone at some point and for a bunch of reasons, but it was a really great time working with amazing people.
