In this post I would like to share three experiences that happened in some of the companies where I worked and it may help you if you someday pass throught the same situation: company downsize.

No matter if it's a big company or a startup, sometimes managers have to do some decisions that may affect their employees live. Not everyone things like the factory manager from this video ([Why good leaders make you feel safe.](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_why_good_leaders_make_you_feel_safe/up-next?language=en)), that I already mentioned before. The truth is that most of the leaders doesn't make you feel safe. We're trying to run a business here, some might get hurt.

So, I can tell you my history:

### My first experience

I was working for a startup in Brazil, it was a really nice project with great professionals, but a small team that ideally will become bigger. But at some point, the money from our unique investor was gone, after a lot of failed tentatives to sell the product. My lucky was that my manager was a great person and he was able to allocate us in different projects, even though he left.

Thinking about it, I can say for sure that some leaders can make you feel safe.

### The second one

Then, I was assigned to this big project but again in a small team. Another good project that was making the company move forward after a some failures to increase the income. Well, long story short, the company downsized and fired most of the employees, but did a fare negotiation with them and even helped them to got a new job.

I was lucky again, as I mentioned, my project was the only one which was providing some income for the company so the team was kept as it was.

### The third one
